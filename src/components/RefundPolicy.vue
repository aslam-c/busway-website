          The company does not provide any order cancellation right to You. You
          will be placing an order after a discussion with the representative of
          the respective transport service provider. The company will not be
          responsible for any loss that happens to you on this behalf. The
          company only provides a medium for booking the tickets that happen in
          real-time. Refunds for the transaction error that may occur will be
          solely depending on the refund policy of the payment gateway service
          provider.
